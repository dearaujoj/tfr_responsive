# Introduction
We have tested the template and it works on version 2.05 of Limesurvey. We have not tested it on earlier versions, so it may probably not work on older versions.

The template will work fine on all modern major browsers. IE8 is not modern, so it will probably fail in that browser. We did not develop this template for IE 8 and we will not support it for use on IE 8.

# License

You are free to alter this template and to use it on any server you want. 
This free template is licenced under GPL 2.0. This means you can do with it whatever you want, even re-sell it to others. We hope you will not do that, since we spent an enormous amount of time on developing it. It's just a question of manners...


# Known Issues
* The exclusive option in multiple choice questions does not work yet, we are working on it


# Premium features
Sometimes you may encounter things that seem to be an issue, but that have been solved in the Premium version. We want the Premium version to be secuctive enough for you to acquire it!
* The question index is styled better in the Premium version
* Slider questions (multiple numerical, slider layout) indicate whether they have been moved or not in the Premium version
* You can place a logo/image per survey in upload/surveys/[SID] (remember to replace [SID] with the SID of your survey on the server) so each survey can have it's own branding in the Premium version
* The Premium version has more color, but not too much. We think that adds to the feeling of comfort of the respondent.
* The Premium version will be developed in several colors, while the Free version will only be available in 1 color.


# New releases
Since we hope to distribute improved versions periodically, we hope that you send us your improvements, so we can incorporate them in newer version. We cannot guarantee that we will incorporate all suggestions, but we will certainly look at them. Please visit our website for news on the template and to download the newest version and to send us your bug reports and suggestions for improvement.
